Water is a significant factor in our lives and climate change. Therefore, water footprint can help us better understand the importance of reducing global water consumption and adapting to the impact climate change has on the water. Water availability is becoming less predictable in many places, and it's our job to protect what we have. Changes in water availability will impact health and food security, and we need more educating resources for people to acknowledge the correlating between water and our everyday life and how we impact the climate. This water footprint guessing game allows people to interact with our computer program and have a sense of the amount of water used for our food. We hope to start making a change by first educating people on this topic.
